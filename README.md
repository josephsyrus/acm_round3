## Task 1: 
Somewhere in the depths of ACM VIT’s Instagram posts lies a clue—a YouTube link to a scene from my all-time favorite show. I left it as a comment on a post about our biggest flagship event, but memory fails me.
Your mission is to track down my comment, uncover the hidden link, and extract the flag from the message I left behind.
Do you have the investigative skills to retrace my digital footsteps?

## Task 3:
Design a malware (decent and working) and submit a writeup explaining the process of making , its working and POC. It should include videos and screenshots.
