## Task 1: 
Somewhere in the depths of ACM VIT’s Instagram posts lies a clue—a YouTube link to a scene from my all-time favorite show. I left it as a comment on a post about our biggest flagship event, but memory fails me.
Your mission is to track down my comment, uncover the hidden link, and extract the flag from the message I left behind.
Do you have the investigative skills to retrace my digital footsteps?


### Procedure:
Since it is mentioned that it is a flagship event, our first step is to list down some of ACM's biggest events.

This narrows it down to posts related to Reverse Coding, Cryptic Hunt, Codex Cryptum

Upon scrolling through related posts, we discover:

Following this link leads us to a youtube video with a clip from the movie "The Study in Pink"

Sorting through the comments leads us to a comment by a user 4n71v3n0m, who says "To prove that you really know OSINT maybe try 0:24 on my name" and claims to be from ACM

The dialogue quoted at 0:24 is "The name is Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221 B Baker Street. Afternoon!"

A quick google search with "Sherlock Holmes 4n71v3n0m" gives us:

We can skip the first website as it does not contain anything related to 4n71v3n0m, and visit the second page

Here we see a user with the same username, so we visit the profile and check activity and other related sections

Finally in one of the user's review, we find the flag

#### The flag is: ACM{5h3rl0ck3d_1n_f0r_4cm}
